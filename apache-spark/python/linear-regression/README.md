### Linear Regression

- Francis Galton in 1800s investigated differences between heights of father and son pairs.
- Galton found that a son's height tended to be closer to the overall average height of all people.
- Galton called this phenomenon 'regression', father's son's height tends to 'regress' or move towards the mean

- goal is to minimize the vertical distance between all the data points and a line
- many ways to minimize this distance:
    - sum of squared errors
    - sum of absolute errors

#### Least Squares Method
- popular method for minimizing distance between all data points and regression line
- minimizes the sum of squares of the residuals, where residual is the difference between an observation and the fitted line
